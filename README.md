Hello everyone - I'm Chase 

I'm a software developer originally from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina now residing in Washington State. I'm a current student at Code Fellows and am eager to learn and expand my coding repertoire. My hobbies include fantasy sports, video games, hiking and kayaking, watching lots of television and listening to podcasts.
